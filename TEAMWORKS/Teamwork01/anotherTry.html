                    As a Tiny Horse intern, I had the amazing opportunity to
                    lead an internal project, engage in collaborative work with
                    other interns, and participate in development sessions that
                    helped to further my growth in marketing techniques. The
                    staff was so welcoming and the office space is incredible.
                    Who wouldn’t love the chance to intern here?!

                    My summer wouldn’t have been the same without this
                    internship. I feel like I’ve grown so much professionally
                    and even more creatively. Now looking forward, I believe I
                    am more equipped to work in this field or anywhere just from
                    this one internship. Just being able to work hands-on with
                    the creative department on real client projects has given me
                    so much hope for what I can pursue professionally here on

                    Not all internships are created equal. The best internships

                    nurtured me with an innovative company culture. As a

                    on social media and web coverage for various series and
                    films. The close-knit atmosphere in the office meant I was

                    firsthand how important business decisions were made, and I
                    was encouraged to be curious and ask questions.
